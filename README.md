## Projects

### [Data Modelling](https://github.com/nexlanglxm/data-modelling)
This project aimed to simulate a dataset representing high-intensity fitness program performance, focusing on blood lactate concentration, heart rate, subjective difficulty level, and caloric expenditure. Developed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, the project explores data modelling, analysis, and interpretation.

**Additional Technologies Used:** Visual Studio Code, pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Seaborn.

### [Data Representation](https://github.com/nexlanglxm/data-representation-coursework/tree/main/project)
The aim of the project was to create a web application that generates personalised playlists based on user music preferences. I produced the backend using Python and Flask, integrating with the Spotify API to retrieve music data, while developing the frontend using HTML and CSS. This project also demonstrated my ability to create and consume RESTful APIs.

### [Fundamentals of Data Analysis](https://github.com/nexlanglxm/fundamentals-of-data-analysis/blob/main/project.ipynb)
This project focuses on exploring and analysing the well-known Iris flower dataset. The project involves loading and understanding the dataset, classifying variables, generating summary statistics, and creating visualisations to derive key insights.

**Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Education
